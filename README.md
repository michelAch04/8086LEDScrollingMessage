# LEDScrollingMessage
Proteus portable 7.10 simulation of a scrolling message on a 8x128 LED matrix using the 8086 microprocessor

Hello! This is a project I worked on in my third year as a computer engineer.
We have two types of scrolling: right to left (8086-assembly-code) and up to down (8086-assembly-up-to-down-code).
I can't figure out how to solve the flickering and delay issues yet, so if anyone knows how to solve the issues, don't hesitate!
